                    Companies striving to be at the forefront of technological development, 
                    sooner or later encounter a problem when the standard tools offered by design 
                    systems become insufficient to solve emerging problems

                The search for a competent specialist may become an even bigger problem. As practice shows, 
                most educational institutions involved in computational training do not pay enough attention to 
                architectural design technologies. A more adequate option is the additional education of students 
                of architectural specialties, but even in this case it all depends on the teaching staff, the 
                process of formation of which falls entirely on the shoulders of your company. <br><br>
                Training specialists on the basis of your own staff is associated with significant 
                time costs, which is completely unacceptable in cases where your competitors have a 
                technological advantage. Large architectural bureaus spend substantial funds on the 
                formation of their own technological portfolio, because in the modern world this is 
                the only way to prove personal competence and reliability.

                    CATIA is a solid modeling program developed by Dassault Systemes. Among the famous 
                    architects extensively using this system, one can name the Pritzker Prize winner - Frank Gehry. 
                    Recently, Dassault Systemes has significantly expanded the range of tools offered to architects 
                    and builders. CATIA automation can be done either through xGen or through a
                    standard COM interface.
                    <br><br>
                    COM is a component interface for application interaction. It is through him that 
                    software systems open access to their API. Despite the fact that this is a rather 
                    mature technology, it is very poorly documented, all information must be extracted 
                    directly from the code. Many programmers use scripting languages ​​built into applications. 
                    Such languages ​​are interpreted and do not offer sufficient performance necessary for
                    numerical calculations. We, in turn, are developers of the Shape Factory system, which 
                    allows us to automate COM applications using the high-performance technical computing 
                    language Julia. Thus, we suggest that you forget about all the problems associated with 
                    interpreted programming languages.

                    Grasshopper is one of the best parametric design systems. Nevertheless, 
                    being built on the basis of Microsoft Net, it inherited all the drawbacks 
                    associated with performance and the lack of libraries necessary for mathematical 
                    calculations. We can say that we turned .Net inside out to connect two different 
                    memory management systems - C # and Julia. Now we have no barriers to develop 
                    high-performance technical calculations in this environment.

                    Dynamo is an alternative to Grasshopper developed by Autodesk, adapted for use with Revit. 
                    In terms of basic technology, it completely duplicates the decisions of its competitor.
